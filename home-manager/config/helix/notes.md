# Helix notes:

## keybinds
### New keybinds
Create and open file:
`:o` + `<C-r>%`
This will use the open file command, and then set the file path to be the same as the current open buffer, which can be used to replace the filename.

### Bad defaults for danish layout

### Impossible defaults for danish layout
Switch to uppercase is impossible bc Alt + grave is not doable on danish layout:
Alt-`	Set the selected text to upper case	switch_to_uppercase

Alt + | not doable on danish layout:
Alt-|	Pipe each selection into shell command, ignoring output	shell_pipe_to
